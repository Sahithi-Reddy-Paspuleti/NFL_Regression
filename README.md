I have choosen the data set provided in the following Github  
https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/nfl-elo-game

The data is the FiveThirtyEight's NFL Predictions

What I have done the project:
1. Determining which team has won
2. Calculating The win count of each team
3. No of games played by each team
4. Calculating the win rate of each team
5. Calculating the average scores, elo ratings and probabilities of each team as each team played with other team several        times not just once.

Regression models used:
1. Linear Regression
2. Random forest

Results:
The acccuracy is more with the Random forest model when compared to linear regression while calculating for both Scores 1 and 2.
